## 🌟 Hi, I'm Liza! 🌟

I'm curious and attentive, exploring the world of code! Currently diving into JavaScript and web development, and always open to learning something new.

👾 Studing Computer science at the Univercity of Prague, Czech Republic <br/>
👾 Web dev in the making — JavaScript is my current playground <br/>
👾 Finding the perfect balance between code & creativity <br/>
👾 Active, friendly and ~~sometimes~~ funny <br/>
👾 Give me some ideas how to call variables, please <br/>

💎 My goal is to become a coding queen.
